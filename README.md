# Bad-YouTube-Terminal-Music-Player
A script to stream music from YouTube in glorified internet radio fashion.

It essentially downloads the video using youtube-dl and plays it in mplayer.

# TODO...
* Piping so it doesn't have to download the whole thing.
* Probably rewriting it in bash instead of python3.
